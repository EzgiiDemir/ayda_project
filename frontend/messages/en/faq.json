      "question": "What is the age limit to have a baby using my own eggs?",
      "answer": "It is not possible to give an exact answer to this. It varies by person and should be determined through tests and ultrasound evaluations.Generally, to achieve healthy results with your own eggs, you should not be menopausal or beyond a certain age. Usually under 35 is considered ideal, but this may vary. As age progresses, egg count, quality, and energy decrease, and genetic issues become more frequent.If you are around 35, not married yet, or do not plan to have a child soon, you may consider freezing your eggs for the future."

    "faq-5": {
      "question": "What is the egg freezing procedure and when is it recommended?",
      "answer": "Egg freezing involves stimulating a woman’s ovaries through hormone injections to mature the egg follicles.After about 12 days of treatment, the follicles are collected under mild anesthesia, and high-quality eggs are frozen and stored.Later, these can be fertilized with the partner’s sperm to form embryos, and healthy embryos can be transferred to achieve pregnancy.This procedure is recommended for women who are not planning to have children soon, those undergoing cancer treatments like chemotherapy, or those who may need to have their ovaries removed for medical reasons."
