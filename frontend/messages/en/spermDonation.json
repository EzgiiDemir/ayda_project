      "It is a treatment used when the intended father’s own sperm is insufficient or absent. Since pregnancy is not possible with the patient’s own sperm, a suitable sperm donor is selected based on blood group and key traits, and—after obtaining the patient’s consent—the donor’s sperm cells are used in treatment.",
      "Mature oocytes are combined with donor sperm in the AYDA IVF laboratory to create embryos. High-quality embryos with a higher chance of pregnancy are then transferred to the mother-to-be."

      "Embryos are cultured in the lab (commonly to day 5) and high-quality embryos are transferred. Twelve days after transfer, a blood β-hCG test reveals the pregnancy result."
